#Bin to Hex
This is a group assignment. The groups are already assigned for you.

Write a program using any high-level language (Java, Python, C/C++, etc) to help you convert from binary, octal, hexadecimal and decimal numbers (integers or floating point numbers).

Your program would

ask the users to enter a number in binary or decimal
ask the users what type of number it is (binary or decimal)
check to make sure the number is legal (a decimal number contains only 0-9). If the number is not legal, it should error out!
If the number is legal, convert the number to the other 3 types (Hint: There are a total of 4 types: binary, octal, hexadecimal, decimal)
Your program needs to do basic error-checking

NOTE: As always, properly document your program. Add in a header with the names of your team members. Add in comments throughout the code

You CANNOT use ANY pre-defined built-in functions to do the conversion such as the following!!

Integer.toString(n,8) // decimal to octal
Integer.toString(n,2) // decimal to binary
Integer.toString(n,16) //decimal to Hex

You must use your functions/methods. Think iteration (loops) or recursion.

Your program needs to mimic the algorithm we discussed in class. You must use the addition/subtraction method or the division/multiplication method
